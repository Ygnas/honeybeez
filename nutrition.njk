            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p>One hundred grams of honey provides about 1,270 kJ (304 kcal) of energy with no significant amounts of
                essential nutrients. Composed of 17% water and 82% carbohydrates, honey has low content of fat, dietary
                fiber, and protein.</p>
            <h3>Sugar profile</h3>
            <p>A mixture of sugars and other carbohydrates, honey is mainly fructose (about 38%) and glucose (about
                32%), with remaining sugars including maltose, sucrose, and other complex carbohydrates. Its glycemic
                index ranges from 31 to 78, depending on the variety. The specific composition, color, aroma, and flavor
                of any batch of honey depend on the flowers foraged by bees that produced the honey.</p>
            <p>One 1980 study found that mixed floral honey from several United States regions typically contains the
                following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fructose: 38.2%</li>
                <li>Glucose: 31.3%</li>
                <li>Maltose: 7.1%</li>
                <li>Sucrose: 1.3%</li>
                <li>Water: 17.2%</li>
                <li>Higher sugars: 1.5%</li>
                <li>Ash: 0.2%</li>
                <li>Other/undetermined: 3.2%</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A 2013 NMR spectroscopy study of 20 different honeys from Germany found that their sugar contents
                comprised:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fructose: 28% to 41%</li>
                <li>Glucose: 22% to 35%</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The average ratio was 56% fructose to 44% glucose, but the ratios in the individual honeys ranged from a
                high of 64% fructose and 36% glucose (one type of flower honey; table 3 in reference) to a low of 50%
                fructose and 50% glucose (a different floral source). This NMR method was not able to quantify maltose,
                galactose, and the other minor sugars as compared to fructose and glucose.</p>
